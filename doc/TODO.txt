1. Implement int32x4.mul without SSE4_1
2. Handle NaN and Infinity for the float32x4
3. The AObench benchmark speedup are quite different between release version and debug version, need investigation
4. IA32 port
5. Register allocator optimization: hinting the result and first operand use the
same register when their representations are different
6. Chromium or Crosswalk or Node-webkit integration for visual benchmark
7. DataView for Float32x4 and Int32x4
8. Alignment, use movaps for heap (allocation), stack (spilling) and external array
9. Add Float32x4 and Int32x4 object into JsonStrignifier (construct a float32x4 object from JSON string)
